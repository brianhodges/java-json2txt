# Read Local .json File and Output .txt File (Java)
Just a reference for myself to refer back to when working on future Java projects. Reads in local JSON file and outputs data in formatted TXT file.

# Setup
*To Run:*
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/brianhodges/java-json2txt
  cd java-json2txt
  javac json2txt.java
  java json2txt
  ```
*A formatted log.txt file will output to the project root*
